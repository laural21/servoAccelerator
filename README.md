# servoAccelerator

This program was created as an assignment for CSCI-SHU 350 - Embedded Computer Systems at NYU Shanghai.
The program uses an STM32F746NG Discovery Board microcontroller to manipulate the rotational speed and direction of a Parallax Continuous Servo Motor.

The program gathers the user's phone's accelerometer data using an HC-06 Bluetooth module through an Android app interface (ServoWalker) that I created with MIT App Inventor for the purpose of this project.
